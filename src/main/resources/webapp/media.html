                    The word autophagy originates from the Greek words auto-,
                    meaning “self”, and phagein, meaning “to eat”.
                    Thus, autophagy denotes “self eating”. This concept
                    emerged during the 1960’s, when researchers first observed
                    that the cell could destroy its own contents by enclosing
                    it in membranes, forming sack-like vesicles that were
                    transported to a recycling compartment, called the lysosome,
                    for degradation. Difficulties in studying the phenomenon
                    meant that little was known until, in a series of brilliant
                    experiments in the early 1990’s, Yoshinori Ohsumi used
                    baker’s yeast to identify genes essential for autophagy.
                    He then went on to elucidate the underlying mechanisms for
                    autophagy in yeast and showed that similar sophisticated
                    machinery is used in our cells.
                    Ohsumi’s discoveries led to a new paradigm in our understanding of how the
                    cell recycles its content. His discoveries opened the path to understanding
                    the fundamental importance of autophagy in many physiological processes, such
                    as in the adaptation to starvation or response to infection. Mutations in
                    autophagy genes can cause disease, and the autophagic process is involved
                    in several conditions including cancer and neurological disease.

                    In the mid 1950’s scientists observed a new specialized cellular compartment,
                    called an organelle, containing enzymes that digest proteins, carbohydrates
                    and lipids. This specialized compartment is referred to as a “lysosome” and
                    functions as a workstation for degradation of cellular constituents. The
                    Belgian scientist Christian de Duve was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology
                    or Medicine in 1974 for the discovery of the lysosome. New observations
                    during the 1960’s showed that large amounts of cellular content, and even
                    whole organelles, could sometimes be found inside lysosomes. The cell
                    therefore appeared to have a strategy for delivering large cargo to the
                    lysosome. Further biochemical and microscopic analysis revealed a new type of
                    vesicle transporting cellular cargo to the lysosome for degradation.
                    Christian de Duve, the scientist behind the discovery of the lysosome,
                    coined the term autophagy, “self-eating”, to describe this process. The new
                    vesicles were named autophagosomes.

                    Yoshinori Ohsumi had been active in various research areas, but upon starting his own lab
                    in 1988, he focused his efforts on protein degradation in the vacuole, an organelle that
                    corresponds to the lysosome in human cells. Yeast cells are relatively easy to study and
                    consequently they are often used as a model for human cells. They are particularly useful
                    for the identification of genes that are important in complex cellular pathways. But Ohsumi
                    faced a major challenge; yeast cells are small and their inner structures are not easily
                    distinguished under the microscope and thus he was uncertain whether autophagy even existed
                    in this organism. Ohsumi reasoned that if he could disrupt the degradation process in the
                    vacuole while the process of autophagy was active, then autophagosomes should accumulate
                    within the vacuole and become visible under the microscope. He therefore cultured mutated
                    yeast lacking vacuolar degradation enzymes and simultaneously stimulated autophagy by starving
                    the cells. The results were striking! Within hours, the vacuoles were filled with small
                    vesicles that had not been degraded (Figure 2). The vesicles were autophagosomes and Ohsumi’s
                    experiment proved that authophagy exists in yeast cells. But even more importantly, he now
                    had a method to identify and characterize key genes involved in this process. This was a major
                    break-through and Ohsumi published the results in 1992.

                    Ohsumi now took advantage of his engineered yeast strains in which autophagosomes
                    accumulated during starvation. This accumulation should not occur if genes important
                    for autophagy were inactivated. Ohsumi exposed the yeast cells to a chemical that
                    randomly introduced mutations in many genes, and then he induced autophagy. His
                    strategy worked! Within a year of his discovery of autophagy in yeast, Ohsumi had
                    identified the first genes essential for autophagy. In his subsequent series of
                    elegant studies, the proteins encoded by these genes were functionally characterized.
                    The results showed that autophagy is controlled by a cascade of proteins and protein
                    complexes, each regulating a distinct stage of autophagosome initiation and formation.

                    After the identification of the machinery for autophagy in yeast, a key question remained.
                    Was there a corresponding mechanism to control this process in other organisms? Soon it became
                    clear that virtually identical mechanisms operate in our own cells. The research tools required
                    to investigate the importance of autophagy in humans were now available.

                    Thanks to Ohsumi and others following in his footsteps, we now know that autophagy controls
                    important physiological functions where cellular components need to be degraded and recycled.
                    Autophagy can rapidly provide fuel for energy and building blocks for renewal of cellular
                    components, and is therefore essential for the cellular response to starvation and other
                    types of stress. After infection, autophagy can eliminate invading intracellular bacteria
                    and viruses. Autophagy contributes to embryo development and cell differentiation. Cells
                    also use autophagy to eliminate damaged proteins and organelles, a quality control mechanism
                    that is critical for counteracting the negative consequences of aging.

                    Disrupted autophagy has been linked to Parkinson’s disease, type 2 diabetes and other disorders
                    that appear in the elderly. Mutations in autophagy genes can cause genetic disease. Disturbances
                    in the autophagic machinery have also been linked to cancer. Intense research is now ongoing to
                    develop drugs that can target autophagy in various diseases.

                    Autophagy has been known for over 50 years but its fundamental importance in physiology and
                    medicine was only recognized after Yoshinori Ohsumi’s paradigm-shifting research in the 1990’s.
                    For his discoveries, he is awarded this year’s Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.
